\description{
This dataset contains the INE codes of the municipalities of Spain with their most recent names (eg: Cabrera d'Igualada appears as Cabrera d'Anoia). For the municipalities that have been merged at some point, their codes are kept separately along with that of the new municipality created (eg: it contains the municipality Oza-Cesuras but also that of Cesuras and Oza dos RÃ­os separately).
